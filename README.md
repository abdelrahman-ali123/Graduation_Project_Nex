## Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive management support system tailored for hospital administration. The system is designed to enhance decision-making processes, improve operational efficiency, and optimize resource allocation within a hospital setting.


## Objectives
> 1. Improve Decision-Making: Provide hospital administrators with accurate and timely information to make informed decisions.
> 2. Enhance Operational Efficiency: Streamline hospital operations to reduce waste and improve service delivery.
> 3. Optimize Resource Allocation: Ensure that hospital resources are used efficiently to meet patient needs effectively.

## Features
> 1. Control Chart Utilization: Visualize quality metrics and performance indicators to monitor and improve hospital services.
